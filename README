NOTES:
- Works on Linux and Windows.
- Currently only Sun, Earth and Luna are implemented.  Further design changes can add more planets.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Scene Graph is rudementary and not very safe.  Basics added for transformations, but not robust for larger scale designs.
- Takes a while for the window to close.  Ran Valgrind on Linux and have fixed all memory leaks, but unsure what causes the delay.
- Animation is slower on Linux.  Unsure why.
